# ctf-writeup  

this will be the place which writeup I wrote in pdf file, and even just in a txt file in folder together with the challenge questions. So there are two, this repository will be the random ctf and non-placement ctf I joined, while for the blog ebsite will be the ctf that I won or some questions that I feel like it feel satisfying when solving specific challenge.
